# Godot Tower: Early Test Build

A rewrite/port of Pizza Tower Early Test Build in Godot Engine (3.x).

## How was this done?

This is done by rewriting the original build's code in GDScript. Obviously, the code simply rewritten won't fully work properly due to various functions missing and differences between GameMaker and Godot in general. Making the code work as intended requires a lot of guesswork and also fixing the rewritten code, with anything collision related being the hardest part of making it work properly.
